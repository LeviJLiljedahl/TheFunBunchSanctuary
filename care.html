        <h2>The Fun Bunch Sanctuary - Taking Care of Your Pets</h2>
        <p>
          One of the first steps to improving animal welfare can take place 
          right in your own home. Perhaps you are thinking about getting an 
          animal companion or already have one. Well, the best thing you can 
          do is to educate yourself about how to best take care of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, be sure to give your furry friend a healthy amount of 
          food each day. Learn the recommended amount based on their species, 
          their size, and their age. Also be sure that your animal friend always
          has access to fresh drinking water.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to provide your friend shelter from the elements.
          Even if they don't stay inside with you, make sure they have some way
          to stay cool in the summer heat, warm in the cold of winter, dry from 
          the rain, and protected from the wind or other elements. A good tip is
          that if you are hot or cold outside, an animal will be too!

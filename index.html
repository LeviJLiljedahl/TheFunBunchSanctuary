          <h3>Newest Addition to the Bunch</h3>
          <img src="images/binky2.jpg" alt="Yogi" width="300" height= "400">
          <p>
            Binky is the newest member of our bunch but only on a technicality.
            He was actually the last born of a group of three kittens. His 
            mother is Lily, a cat that was abandoned in the neighborhood. Soon, 
            after bringing Lily in, we found out she was actually pregnant.
            She soon gave birth to Kirby, Willow, and last but not least Binky.

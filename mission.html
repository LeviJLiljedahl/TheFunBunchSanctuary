        <h2>The Fun Bunch Sanctuary - Our Mission</h2>
        <p> 
          The Fun Bunch Santuary's mission is simple, to improve the lives
          of as many animals as we can. We can accomplish this not only by taking
          in animals who have been abused, neglected, or abandoned and giving
          them a forever home right here at the sanctuary, but by working with
          and educating others to help improve animal welfare as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there are still many people out there that see animals
          as lesser than or simply as property to be used in any way that they
          see fit. Our mission is to help the world to realize that all animals
          should be treated with the respect that they deserve. That is why, 
          here at the sanctuary, we don't consider "the bunch" to be pets but 
          we consider them to be our family and we treat them with the same 
          respect that we would treat any other human member of our family.
        </p>
        <p>
          By working with other individuals and organizations we hope to 
          improve animal welfare, not only in our local area, but across the 
          United States and perhaps one day the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can help to make a difference by continuing to treat the animals
          in your life with respect and by continuing to educate yourself on 
          how to best care for them. You can also make a difference by 
          spreading your knowledge throughout your community and by helping 
          any animal you see in need.

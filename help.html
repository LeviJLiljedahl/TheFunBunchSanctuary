        <h2>The Fun Bunch Sanctuary - How to Help</h2>
        <p>
          While it may seem impossible to try to help all the animals in the 
          world, the truth is that there are many things that you can do to make
          a difference, either in your local community or beyond. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the littlest thing can make a big difference in an 
          animals life. If you see a critter in your neighbor that needs help,
          take action. Whether this means bringing them inside from the harsh
          elements, giving them some food or water, calling someone else or 
          an organization that can help, or more. Also, if you see anyone that
          is treating an animal poorly dont be afraid to report them. Most 
          communities allow for annonymous tips, respecting your privacy but 
          helping those in need. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, there are many programs, in almost every community, that allow
          you to either make donations or volunteer your time to help animals 
          in the community. Whether it be a humane society, a shelter, or even
          another sanctuary, if you decide to help out, everyone, especially the 
          animals, will really appreciate it.
        </P>
        <p>

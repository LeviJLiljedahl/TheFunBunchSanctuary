        <h2>The Fun Bunch Sanctuary - About Us</h2>
        <h3> How we Started</h3>
        <p>
          The Fun Bunch Sanctuary was officially founded by the Marquardt family
          in 2021, but the family has been taking in and caring for 
          animals long before. It started with local cats and dogs who were 
          abandoned and has grown from there. Located on 10 acres in Chetek, 
          Wisconsin, The Fun Bunch Sanctuary is home to animals of all species. 
          At the moment the "bunch", as they have become known as, is comprised 
          of cats and dogs, but the sanctuary is open to any animal in need of 
          a forever home. To learn more about what we do, feel free to click the
          following link, <a href="what_do.html">What We Do</a>. If you would 
          like to learn more about our mission, click the following 
          link, <a href="mission.html">Our Mission</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We first saw the need for a safe place for animals when the 
          COVID-19 pandemic began. One of the first things that happened when
          people were required to stay at home, was that many people rushed out
          to humane societies across the U.S. and adopted cats, dogs, and other
          animal companions. This is great, who better to spend the day with than
          a furry friend. The problem was that when people began returning to work
          many animals were surrendered or abandoned due to lack of time.
          While it is better to give an animal
          to a proper shelter rather than just abandoning them, this can still 
          be tough on the animal. We, meaning the founders of The Fun Bunch 
          Sanctuary, realized that animals of all kinds need stability to be 
          happy. That is when we really opened our doors and began our mission 
          of improving the quality of life for as many critters as possible.
          Thus, The Fun Bunch and their Sanctuary was created!

          <h2>Volunteers and What they Do!</h2>
          <p>
            At the Fun Bunch Sanctuary we rely very heavily on the kindness of 
            fellow animal lovers and those willing to volunteer their time to 
            help. Being a completely non-profit 
            organization that does not sell any products or services, all of the 
            supplies and anything else the animals need come directly out of our
            pockets or from the donations of generous patrons. As such, we are
            unable to afford any paid workers. Therefore, generous volunteers 
            donate their time each week to help out and care for the animals. 
            Volunteers each week will and may do any of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spend time with the animals</li>
            <li>Take dogs for walks around the property</li>
            <li>Play with the cats</li>
            <li>Help clean up after the pets</li>
            <li>Help maintain the property</li>
            <li>Cuddle with any animals that want it</li>
            <li>And much more</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Volunteers are free to come and go as they please, as well as set 
            their own hours. We have all volunteers sign in when they arrive and 
            sign out when they leave, in order to keep track of all those who 
            donate their time. Then, once a year, to show our appreciation, we 
            throw a huge celebration and invite back all of the
            volunteers who have donated their time. This celebration includes 
            food, drinks, fun, and games for all ages and all species!
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to extend a huge thank you to all those who 
            volunteer and/or donate. What we do would not be possible without 
            special people like you. From all of the animals and us humans at 
            The Fun Bunch Sanctuary, we say Thank You!
          </p>
